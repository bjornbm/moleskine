# Prerequisites

Install `cpdf` from http://community.coherentpdf.com or from:
https://github.com/coherentgraphics/cpdf-binaries/archive/master.zip (put OSX binary in ~/.local/bin and manual in ~/Documents)

On macOS:

```sh
cp ~/Downloads/cpdf-binaries-master/OSX-ARM/cpdf ~/.local/bin/
xattr -cr ~/.local/bin/cpdf  # Trust executable
```
Alternatively, install and use `pdftk` instead

# Running

If using _pdftk_, modify commenting at the end of `app/Main.hs` accordingly.

```
stack build
cpdf -scale-to-fit a5portrait in.pdf in_a5p.pdf  # optional
mkdir out
stack exec index.txt in_a5p.pdf

```

# Notes

It doesn't work to include the `-scale-to-file` and the page numbers on the same line, apparently. Therefore the need to resize before creating pages.
